# Project-1
This is a group project for UCI bootcam.

We as a group created a website that allows users to have access to 1000's of recipes for both food and drinks. Using two API's from CocktailDB and Edamame, we were able to create a slick and interactive website that is both easy to follow and appealing to the eye. 

User friendliness was the driving factor when creating this website. We wanted any individual to be able to have access to our website and navigate through with ease. 

We used Materialize to help give a professional and welcoming look for our user interface.

We incorporated slick.js to bring a sense of accesibility for any individual.

Jquery and Ajax were the primary tools used to scrape data from the API's.

In the future, we want to have access to Edamame's Commercial API so that user's will have access to the whole API at any moment and not be restraint to a finite amount of calls. We also want to incorporate tags and filters that will help with user's selections when looking for certain foods and/or drinks.
